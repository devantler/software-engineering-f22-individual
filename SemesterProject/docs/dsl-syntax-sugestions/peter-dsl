create crane named "fishing rod"
with position at 30 named "intake"
with position at 120 named "red"
with posttion at 140 named "green"
with position at 160 named "blue"

create storage named "storage"
with 8 slots
with position at slot 3 named "crane"
with position at slot 6 named "camera"
with position at slot 1 named "intake"

create camera named "scanner"
with color red
with color blue
with color green

--------logic loop-------------
"storage" move empty to "intake"
"storage" fill "intake"
"storage" move "intake" to "camera"
"scanner" scan
"storage" if blue at "camera" wait 10
"storage" if red at "camera" wait 20
"storage" if green at "camera" wait 30

"storage" move done to "crane"
"storage" if blue at "crane" and "crane" < 4 blue
    "crane" put blue from "intake" in "blue"
"storage" if red at "crane" and "crane" < 10
    "crane" put from "intake" in "red"
"storage" if green at "crane"
    "crane" put from "intake" in "green"
"storage" empty "crane"
