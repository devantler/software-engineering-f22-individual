\section{UPPAAL project file formats}

While utilizing UPPAAL as a model checker it was discovered that UPPAAL supports multiple project file formats, e.g., XML and XTA. The XTA format is more concise than XML, and as such, it might be favorable as a code-generation target. \\
To save a UPPAAL project to the XTA format, one must change the file extension to '.xta' when saving the project. Doing so will create three files.

\begin{itemize}
    \item .xta this is the file that contains the full UPPAAL system and is the only one required to exist to open the project.
    \item .q this is the file that contains all the verification rules.
    \item .ugi this file describes the layout. It contains all elements in the layout and their x and y values.
\end{itemize}

If code generating UPPAAL is of interest, the '.xta' project file is a great candidate.
