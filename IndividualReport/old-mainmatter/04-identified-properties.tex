There is a lack of requirements considering system performance. Therefore, a sub-performance section could be added that handles verification rules on a smaller scale instead of the present grand scale. Two possible requirements for the sub-performance verification could be:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Is torque changed within $x$ amount of time after a request?
    \item Is speed changed within $x$ amount of time after a request?
\end{itemize}
\vspace{1em}

Furthermore, an additional requirement could be to verify that the system cannot end up in an irrecoverable state. This would look as follows:

\begin{itemize}
    \item $A[] \text{ deadlock imply } (\text{ErrStat} > 0)$
\end{itemize}
