\section{Usability of UPPAAL}

During the implementation of the Gear Controller system, the usage and capabilities of the UPPAAL tool have been evaluated. \\
Some advantages of the tool include the simplicity of usage, visibility, and the availability of templates. It is also well-equipped for timed automata. \\
Furthermore, some disadvantages of the tool are: extremely manual, limited data types, a disconnection between simulation and product, and the simulator does not allow to see the clocks' values. Additionally, the tool is, in general, quite buggy.
