\section{Failing properties}

As stated in section \ref{sec:identified_properties}, the models within the article, \citetitle{gearcontrol}, were not directly translatable into UPPAAL. The group recognized this while using the verifier tool, as not all verification rules were satisfied. As an example, it was noticed that the clock \textit{GCTImer} in the transition from \textit{initiate} to \textit{CheckTorque} was never below or equal to 255, as it was required. The timing issue resulted from the timer incrementing before receiving the request for zero torque. A solution was implemented by adding a committed location to the node, ensuring the timer froze until the signal to continue was received. Later we realized that this was also stated within the models in the article, \citetitle{gearcontrol}, but it was marked differently from how it is visualized in UPPAAL.

Furthermore, the group found it confusing that there were deadlocks in the system, in all cases where the variable $ErrStat$ was larger than 0, as \citeauthor{gearcontrol} states there should be no deadlocks in the system. A solution for this could be to extend the UPPAAL templates with the possibility of using the clutch to switch gears in cases where the gear controls would fail to do so.
