\section{Feedback}

The overall feedback was good; in particular, the peer-reviewing group was fond of our use of colors within the models, committed location, and comments for verification rules in the verifier. Presenting the XTA project file format was also well received. \\
However, the peer-reviewing group critiqued that we did not check for deadlocks in the system.
