\subsection{Problem and Objective}\label{sec:problem-objective}

\paragraph{The Problem -} As the world is moving to industry 4.0 a new set of challenges arise; devices are becoming more interconnected, and a new level of autonomy is reached. How this revolutionary step will affect industrial production is exciting. In particular, it is interesting to examine some of the challenges that occur when building production systems that operate on industry 4.0 technology. Especially how such systems remain reliable and safe, and how they can be built to be re-configurable and highly flexible. 

\paragraph{The Objective  -} This project sets out to examine the problem space by utilizing knowledge and tools from \acrlong{msd}, \acrlong{sm-iot}, and \acrlong{ssav} to build a re-configurable storing, scanning, and moving installation that runs on industry 4.0 technology. The installation is required to operate reliably and safely.
